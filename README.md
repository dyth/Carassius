# Carassius

Carassius is a prototypical chess agent trained by Deep Reinforcement Learning. It is based on Juno, an RL tic-tac-toe agent.

The names of both agents are derived from qualities of pieces used in the game.

Chesspieces can either be black or white, or light and dark. The Renaissance painter Michelangelo Merisi da Caravaggio painted in a style called Chiaraoscuro, which explored the contrast between light and dark. The fish genus Carassius share the same four letters as Caravaggio as well as being noted their colorful rays -- with ray being a term physisists use to describe light. As chess agents are named after fish, this agent is called Carassius.

The most well-known species of Carassius are Goldfish.
