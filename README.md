# Carassius

Carassius is a prototypical chess agent trained by Deep Reinforcement Learning.

Much of its code is based from Juno. Due to its resemblance, both agents are named after the types of pieces used by players of the game. In chess, pieces can either be black or white. Chiaraoscuro, or stark contrast between light and dark was also explored by the Renaissance painter Michelangelo Merisi da Caravaggio. In addition to sharing the same four intial characters as Caravaggio, the genus of fish known as Carassius are noted for their rays, a term used by physisists to describe light. The most well-known species of Carassius are Goldfish.
